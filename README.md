## üìñ TSGaussian: Semantic and Depth-Guided Target-Specific Gaussian Splatting from Sparse Views

üî• 2D detection, semantic segmentation, and 3D reconstruction of specific target objects;‚≠ê Separation of reconstructed 3D objects based on their semantic identities, enabling distinct handling of different semantic components; üî• High-quality 3D reconstruction and rendering in sparse-view scenarios without compromising reconstruction quality.

üö©¬†**Updates**

‚òë  We develop an algorithm that extends high-performing 2D scene understanding techniques to the 3D domain in sparse views.

‚òë The code and data will be released after the paper's acceptance. Please stay tuned.

‚òê   Build your own data set for training
