## 📖 TSGaussian: Semantic and Depth-Guided Target-Specific Gaussian Splatting from Sparse Views

🔥 2D detection, semantic segmentation, and 3D reconstruction of specific target objects;⭐ Separation of reconstructed 3D objects based on their semantic identities, enabling distinct handling of different semantic components; 🔥 High-quality 3D reconstruction and rendering in sparse-view scenarios without compromising reconstruction quality.

🚩 **Updates**

☑  We develop an algorithm that extends high-performing 2D scene understanding techniques to the 3D domain in sparse views.

☐ The code and data will be released after the paper's acceptance. Please stay tuned.
